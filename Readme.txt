How the hell do I run this?

To run this project, put everything (including the exe and all the dll, obj, o, jpeg and vert & frag shader files) in a clean folder and run the "untitled" file. Glew32 and GLFW3 was compiled under 64 bit windows, so you may have to compile your own version of GLEW and GLFW if you're on a 32 bit windows mashine. Add the dll's with the exact same name into the folder containing this README, and the project should be able to run.

About the content.

A great deal of this project is actually made up of blocks of code provided by "http://www.opengl-tutorial.org" and the "Benny" guy on youtube. I messed around with the codes a bit, but many many thanks to both of you.

*********************************************************************************************
ToC (Table of Content) - what this project contains in terms of technical methods and solutions:

1. Wavefront obj loader
2. vertex and fragment shader loader
3. jpeg texture loader (stb_image)
4. multiple texture mapping
5. light effects: ambient + diffusion + specular reflection

This list will be updated.
*********************************************************************************************
THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET DONE.

I'd like to extend this project to something more interesting or more useful in one way or another. So here's the traditional "TODO List":

1. Add FPS counter to main frame (per texturing).
2. Add Shadows.
3. Add mouse & keyboard control over camera (probably with help of SDL2).

I'd actually like this project to become a "naive" game engine. Hard work....
